3. [**JavaScript Data Types**](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp) - *When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string. JS types are **dynamic*. This means that same variable can be used to hold different data types.   
JS 8 data types:  
    + [**String**](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_strings.asp) - is a series of characters like "John Doe". Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes. You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string.
    + [**Number**](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_numbers.asp) - All JavaScript numbers are stored as decimal numbers (double,64-bit floating point).Numbers can be written with, or without decimals.
    + [**Bigint**](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_bigint.asp) - All JavaScript numbers are stored in a a 64-bit floating-point format. JavaScript BigInt is a new datatype (ES2020) that can be used to store integer values that are too big to be represented by a normal JavaScript Number.
    + [**Boolean**](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_booleans.asp) - Booleans can only have two values: true or false.
    + **Undefined**
    + **Null** - set value to none
    + **Symbol**
    + **Object**, data type can contain: 
        + [**an array**](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp) - JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets. Array items are separated by commas. The following code declares (creates) an array called cars, containing three items (car names):  
        Example
        ``` javascript
        const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
        ```
        Array indexes are zero-based, which means the first item is [0], second is [1], and so on.
        + **an object**
        + **a data**.  
4. [`Variable declaration`](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp) - can be declared in 4 ways:
    + automatically
    + [`var`]() - will be able to used in whole program.
    + [`let`](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_let.asp) - used only in scope where you declared it. 
    + [`const`](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_const.asp) - is variable that will never change. 

|       | scope | Redeclare | Reassign | Hoisted | Binds this |
| ----- | ----- | --------- | -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| var   | NO    | YES       | YES      | YES     | YES        |
| lest  | YES   | NO        | YES      | NO      | NO         |
| const | YES   | NO        | NO       | NO      | NO         |

5. [`<script></script>`](https://www.w3schools.com/Tags/tag_script.asp)- is used to embed a clint-side script (JS). The `<script></script>` element either contains scripting statements or it points to an external file though the src attribute.  
**A single `<script>` tag canâ€™t have both the src attribute and code inside.**  
``` javascript
// the content is ignored, because src is set
<script src="file.js">
  alert(1); 
</script>
// GOOD
<script src="file.js"></script>
<script>
  alert(1);
</script>
```  
6. **declare** and **asign** - declare is to create adata objecy and give a name, so that you can reference it later in your code. To assign is to gie it a value.  
Example:
``` javascript
// Declare "firstName" constant
const firstName;

// Assign it a value of "Jim"
firstName = "Jim";
```
