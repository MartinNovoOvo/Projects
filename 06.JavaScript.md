3. [**JavaScript Data Types**](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp) - *When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string. JS types are **dynamic*. This means that same variable can be used to hold different data types.   
JS 8 data types:  
    + [**String**](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_strings.asp) - is a series of characters like "John Doe". Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes. You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string.
    + [**Number**](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_numbers.asp) - All JavaScript numbers are stored as decimal numbers (double,64-bit floating point).Numbers can be written with, or without decimals.
    + [**Bigint**](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_bigint.asp) - All JavaScript numbers are stored in a a 64-bit floating-point format. JavaScript BigInt is a new datatype (ES2020) that can be used to store integer values that are too big to be represented by a normal JavaScript Number.
    + [**Boolean**](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_booleans.asp) - Booleans can only have two values: true or false.
    + **Undefined**
    + **Null**
    + **Symbol**

        + [**an array**](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp) - JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets. Array items are separated by commas. The following code declares (creates) an array called cars, containing three items (car names):  
        Example
        ``` javascript
        const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
        ```
        Array indexes are zero-based, which means the first item is [0], second is [1], and so on.
        + **an object**
        + **a data**.
